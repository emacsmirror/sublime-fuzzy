# sublime-fuzzy
> Fuzzy matching algorithm based on Sublime Text's string search

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Build](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-legacy/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Build [sublime_fuzzy](https://github.com/Schlechtwetterfront/fuzzy-rs) in Rust
to Emacs loadable binaries.

This is the same with [flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx) created by [lewang](https://github.com/lewang/),
but this is powered by pre-built binaries using [Emacs Dynamic Modules](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html).
You might consider using this package if you want some performance gained!

## üî® Usage

Load by calling the following function,

```el
(sublime-fuzzy-load-dyn)
```

Calculate the score with `PATTERN` and `SOURCE`:

```el
(sublime-fuzzy-score "something" "some else thing")
```
