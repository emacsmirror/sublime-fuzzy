> Fuzzy matching algorithm based on Sublime Text's string search

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Build](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/sublime-fuzzy/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is the same with [flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx) created by @lewang,
but this is powered by pre-built binaries using [Emacs Dynamic Modules](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html).
You might consider using this package if you want some performance gained!

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

Load by calling the following function,

```el
(sublime-fuzzy-load-dyn)
```

Calculate the score with `PATTERN` and `SOURCE`:

```el
(sublime-fuzzy-score "something" "some else thing")
```
